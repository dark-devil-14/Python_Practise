# A. ASCII Art Contest

# Three leading AI-powered creative assistants—Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude—enter the first ever ASCII Art Contest,
#  where they must impress a panel of human judges with their text-based masterpieces.

# Each participant receives a score between 80 and 100 (inclusive). 
# The organizers want to announce the final standing only if the judges' opinions are "close enough"; 
# otherwise, they will ask the judges to reconsider.

# Given the three integer scores of Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude, determine the contest result:
# If the maximum score and the minimum score differ by at least 10 points, print check again (the judging seems inconsistent, so the panel must re-evaluate).
# Otherwise, print final X, where X is the median of the three scores (the score that would be in the middle if all three were sorted in non-decreasing order). 


nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

    print("check again")
